Installation
============

Requirements
------------

 * Python 2.6+
 * Exempi 2.1.1+
 * Linux or OS X (see notes below for Windows)


Python XMP Toolkit
----------------------
The short version of installation is::

  python setup.py install

Note, in case you haven't installed Exempi you will get an
:exc:`ExempiLoadError` exception once you try to load :mod:`libxmp`.

Exempi
------
Python XMP Toolkit requires Exempi 2.1.1 or higher which can be downloaded from
http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi.  It is probably already
installed if you are working on linux.

To install Exempi, unpack the distribution and run::

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Version 2.1.0 is known not to work.

Mac OS X 
--------
Note Exempi requires boost (http://www.boost.org/) to compile, so on OS X you
probably need to run configure with one of the following options.::

  ./configure --with-darwinports
  ./configure --with-fink 

.. warning::
	Note, only Exempi 2.1.1 compiles on OS X and Exempi 2.1.1 also fixes an issue over 2.1
	that could lead to complete crash of the Python interpreter.

Windows 
-------
The library has not been tested on Windows, and nor has any serious effort
been made to test it. Hence, developers wanting to use the library on Windows
are encouraged to try it out and let us know if it works.

The library ought to work on Windows, if Exempi can be compiled as a DLL using
e.g. Cygwin.
