The Files module provides support for locating the XMP in a file, adding XMP to
a file, or updating the XMP in a file. It returns the entire XMP packet, the
core pacakage can then be used to manipulate the individual XMP properties.
:class:`XMPFiles` contains a number of "smart" file handlers that know how to
efficiently access the XMP in specific file formats. It also includes a
fallback packet scanner that can be used for unknown file formats.

    XMPFiles provides the API for the Exempi's File Handler component.  This

    The general model is to open a file, read and write the metadata, then
    close the file. While open, portions of the file might be maintained in RAM
    data structures. Memory usage can vary considerably depending on file
    format and access options. The file may be opened for read-only or
    read-write access, with typical exclusion for both modes.
