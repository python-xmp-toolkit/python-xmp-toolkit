Python XMP Toolkit is a library for working with XMP metadata, as well as
reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats.

Python XMP Toolkit is wrapping `Exempi <https://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi/>`_
(using ctypes), a C/C++ XMP library based on Adobe XMP Toolkit, ensuring that future
updates to the XMP standard are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum
amount of work.

Python XMP Toolkit has been developed by:
 * ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency
 * ESO - European Southern Observatory
 * CRS4 - Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia
